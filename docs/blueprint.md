## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very dark blue-gray (#222831) to create a sophisticated, focused atmosphere.
- Accent color: A muted teal (#63A375) to add a touch of calm and innovation.
- Clean, sans-serif fonts for readability.
- Crisp, professional icons related to legal processes and document types.
- A structured and organized layout for easy navigation.
